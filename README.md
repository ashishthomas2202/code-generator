# Code Generator

## Overview

The **Code Generator** project is a powerful tool designed to bridge the gap between natural language and programming code. Its primary purpose is to transform human-readable instructions in the form of natural language into executable code in various programming languages. This innovative solution simplifies the process of coding, making it more accessible to individuals with varying levels of programming expertise.

## Features

### 1. Natural Language Input

The Code Generator allows users to input instructions in plain English or another natural language of their choice. This user-friendly interface eliminates the need for in-depth programming knowledge, enabling a wider audience to harness the power of code generation.

### 2. Multi-Language Support

The project supports multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more. Users can specify their desired target language when generating code.

### 3. Customizable Templates

The Code Generator employs customizable code templates for different programming tasks. Users can define their templates or select from a library of pre-existing templates, further streamlining the code generation process.

### 4. Error Handling

The project includes robust error-handling mechanisms to provide helpful feedback when natural language inputs cannot be accurately converted into code. This helps users refine their instructions and improve their coding skills.

### 5. Extensibility

Developers can extend the project to support additional programming languages or enhance its natural language processing capabilities. The open-source nature of the Code Generator encourages community contributions and improvements.

## Getting Started
